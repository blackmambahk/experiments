# ServiceWorker
Basic ServiceWorker implementation and a framework for merging multiple handlers

Browsers only allow one ServiceWorker per scope but a PWA will generally need multiple ServiceWorkers to handle different types of actions.
So we add support to merge multiple handlers into a single ServiceWorker

Note that ServiceWorkers by default are scoped to where they load from and below and will require a SERVICE-WORKER-ALLOWED response header to be scoped at a higher level, don't bother it's too much trouble, just always load from root of the app, this framework then allows the handlers to be loaded from anywhere.

# ServerSentEvents
whenever you send two new line characters the message is sent automatically

#### Message Construction

**ID**: If the field value does not contain U+0000 NULL, then set the last event ID buffer to the field value. Otherwise, ignore the field.

**Data**: Append the field value to the data buffer, then append a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character to the data buffer.

**Event**: Set the event type buffer to the field value. This leads to event.type getting your custom event name.

**Retry**: If the field value consists of only ASCII digits, then interpret the field value as an integer in base ten, and set the event streamâ€™s reconnection time to that integer. Otherwise, ignore the field.

You can send multiple messages separated by a new line as long as you provide different IDs.
